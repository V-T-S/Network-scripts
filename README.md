As I deal with many traffic analysis issues during my day to day, I have deceided to use Python to create a new way to review and focus on specific traffic.
The script allows me to put all the data into several file types like PDF, CSV and JSON as well as plotting the graphic review to make things mre understandable.
The script is full of comments for each part, feel free to enhance and adjust to your own needs!
